description: Integrate skeletons into your project quickly and easily using Skel UI in minutes.
---

import Portal from "app/Portal";
import PostCardOld from "codes/PostCard.Old";
import { PostCard } from "@skel-ui/react/$components";

## Install package

Install Skel UI into your project via command line.

<div className="[&_button]:capitalize 1st:[&_button]:uppercase 2nd:[&_button]:uppercase">
```package-install
@skel-ui/react
```
</div>

## Import CSS

Import the CSS file into the root of your application.

```js
import "@skel-ui/react/styles.css";
```

## Implement Skel UI

Consider a PostCard component that shows a spinner while the data is being fetched.

<Portal>
  <PostCardOld />
</Portal>

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./codes/snippets/PostCard.Old.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": ""
  }
}
```

Let's replace the spinner loading with skeleton loading. To accomplish this, just follow two steps:

1. Replace the ternary operator with `<Skel.Root>`.
2. Substitute your HTML elements with Skel UI elements (e.g., `h1` becomes `Skel.h1`).

<Portal>
  <PostCard />
</Portal>

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./codes/snippets/PostCard.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": ""
  }
}
```
