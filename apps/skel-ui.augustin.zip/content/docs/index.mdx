description: Skel UI resolves the challenges of implementing skeletons by eliminating the need to create dedicated loading screens and providing an easier way to manage skeleton states using react-context.
---

import Portal from "app/Portal";
import { PostCard } from "@skel-ui/react/$components";

## Install package

Install Skel UI into your project via command line.

```package-install
@skel-ui/react
```

## Import CSS

Import the CSS file into the root of your application.

```js
import "@skel-ui/react/styles.css";
```

## Start crafting

Now it's time for you to craft your user interface to life!

<Portal>
  <PostCard />
</Portal>

<Tabs items={["PostCard.tsx", "PostCard.css"]}>

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./content/code/PostCard/index.tsx",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "tsx",
    "meta": "tab=\"PostCard.tsx\""
  }
}
```

```json doc-gen:file
{
  "file": "./content/code/PostCard/index.css",
  "codeblock": {
    "lang": "css",
    "meta": "tab=\"PostCard.css\""
  }
}
```

</Tabs>

Now, not only have you designed the skeleton, but you have also done the actual UI. Additionally, the loading state for the entire UI is handled in a single place at `<Skel.Root>`.
